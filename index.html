                    The goal of this game is to have as few pieces on the board at the end of the game.
                    In order to remove pieces from the board you must "jump" one piece over another.
                    To perform a jump you must move a piece over one space diagonally or horizontally and you must move into a open space.
                    Good Luck!
                </p>
